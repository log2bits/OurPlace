# OurPlace
- Users place colored pixels on a world map in real-time, like w place
- Start with 50 pixels, get 1 new pixel every 30 seconds, max capacity grows as you place more
- See other people's pixels appear instantly as they work
- Anyone can report bad content by drawing a rectangle around it
- Content only goes to moderation review if multiple people flag the same area
- Under-18 users can report but can't be moderators (honor system for 18+)
- Moderators opt-in through a separate moderation tab
- Moderators get assigned flagged content at fixed time intervals based on queue size
- Some moderation entries are old known-bad content to catch bad moderators
- Good moderation votes earn you extra pixels to place on the canvas
- Lightweight AI runs in everyone's browser to auto-detect obvious bad content
- Flagged areas that pass multiple human reviews get their creators banned
- Users who repeatedly vote with tiny minorities (<10%) get flagged as bad moderators
- Big countdown timer at the top - when it hits zero, the site shuts down
- Only way to add time is buying pixels ($1 = +1 hour added to timer)
- No other purchases, cosmetics, or premium features - just pixels
- Creates community pressure to keep funding the site when timer gets low
- Built in Rust for cheap server costs even with millions of users
- Tile-based storage system like Google Maps for efficient pixel loading
- WebSocket connections for instant pixel updates
